OPTIONS request supported ([RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.2))

> The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.

## Content-Negotiation for language

prefer English

prefer Japanese

```

```

## Hypermedia API

The API is a **self documented** and **discoverable** RESTful HAL(Hyper Application Language) API. HAL is a format based on json that establishes conventions for representing links. For example:

```
{
    "_links": {
        "self": { "href": "/orders" },
        "next": { "href": "/orders?page=2" }
    }
}
```
More detail about HAL can be found at http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html.

Hypermedia API navigate around the resources by following links. Start by request the URI (/) of the route in the same way as the web site. 

```
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8081/
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Host: 127.0.0.1:8081
Date: Sat, 12 Aug 2017 11:57:05 +0200
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.1.4
content-type: application/hal+json

{
    "message": "Welcome to the Polidog.Todo API ! Our hope is to be as self-documenting and RESTful as possible.",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/"
        },
        "curies": [
            {
                "href": "http://localhost:8081/rels/{?rel}",
                "name": "pt",
                "templated": true
            }
        ],
        "pt:todo": {
            "href": "/todo",
            "title": "todo item"
        },
        "pt:todos": {
            "href": "/todos",
            "title": "todo list"
        }
    }
}

```

**CURIE** help providing links to resource documentation. It gives you a reserved link relation `curies` which you can use to hint at the location of resource documentation.

Links in turn can then prefix their `rel` with a CURIE name. Associating the `todo` link with the doc documentation CURIE results in a link `rel` set to `pt:todo`.

To retrieve documentation about the `todo` resource, the client will expand the associated CURIE link with the actual link's `rel`. This would result in a URL http://127.0.0.1:8081/rels/?rel=todo which is expected to return documentation about this resource.

Create TODO according to the document.

```
curl -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/todo -d "title=walking"
```

```

        "id": "2",
        "title": "walking",
        "status": "1",
        "created": "2017-08-12 12:07:08",
        "updated": "2017-08-12 12:07:08",
        "status_name": "Complete"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "/todo?id=2"
        }
    }
}
```

or by JSON (Reuqest condent-renogotiation with is default)

```
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8081/todo -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title":"think" }'
```

The API is fully compatible with [mikekelly/hal-browser](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser) REST API browser.

## Content-Negotiation for API media type


prefer HAL+JSON API

```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/hal+json' http://127.0.0.1:8081/todos
```

prefer JSON API

```
curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:8081/todos
